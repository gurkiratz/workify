## Getting Started
First, install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

And then run the project:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Inspiration
Imagine you need a micro-task to be done, which contains work that needs input from numerous people. All you need is Workify. At Workify, we facilitate people by outsourcing their work using our platform, which can help them make micro-payments even in cents that is not possible 

## What it Does
Our project has two interfaces, one for the user and the other for the worker. The user interface is used to upload the tasks to be done and the worker interface is where people can complete tasks and earn crypto tokens.

## How We Built It
- Backend - Node, express, S3 SDK, Zod, Prisma, PostgreSQL
- Frontend - Near BOS, Next.js, Tailwind

## Challenges We Ran Into
- connection with the database
- learning about Near
- uploading images to S3 using a pre-signed URL
- coming up with the structure of backend APIs

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- Learning about Near protocol
- First time building a DAP (Decentralized Application)
- Coming up with this amazing idea

## What We Learned
After working on this project for the previous 36 hours, we learned a plethora of things including what is Near all about and how their protocol works, we learned how to create and work with Decentralized Applications (DAP) and, we also learned how to work with S3 service.

## What's Next?
Next, we would like to integrate our app with Near, we would like to deploy our frontend on the blockchain using BOS (Blockchain OS) and we would like to add more kinds of tasks and media support on our website.
